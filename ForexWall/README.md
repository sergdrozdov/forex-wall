Forex Live Wall
----------------------------------------------------------

Forex is a decentralized global market where all the worldâ€™s currencies trade. For this exercise, what
we need is a simple live wall for tracking currencies. For free keyless and real time API you may use
https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/forex

## Task description

**Requirements:**
1. The project should use npm/yarn package manage r to manage dependencies.
2. The client application should be a single page application with 3 components:
	a. an input field to accept the currency pair (E.g. USD/EUR) as a query string
	b. the search button to submit data
	c. the live wall which should show the query results and live updates
3. You can use Vanilla JS, Angular 8+, React or any other JavaScript UI framework de jour.
4. No strict guidelines for styling - you may use vanilla CSS, any methodology or preprocessor.
5. Business functionality:
	a. The page by default should show the wall empty.
	b. When the user inputs a query string and presses the search button the application should fetch the latest data for the currency pair.
	c. It should poll data on configurable (UI or code, your call) time frame and update the wall with forex changes in real-time.
6. Unit tests using Jasmine, Jest or any other testing framework
7. To simplify things, it is OK to only support Chrome browser.
8. Deliver the code either in git or as a zip file.
9. Make sure to document your project in a simple README file so it would be easier for us to set up, run and test your application.

**Guidelines and Tips**
* Implement best practices on how you see fit.
* Using typescript is a plus.
* Design the page in such a way that it is user-friendly and responsible. Layout-wise, device-wise, etc.
* The minimum business requirements are defined in step 5 above. But feel free to add components to make the application easier to use (charts, help links, tooltips, etc.).
* Be resourceful. The internet is at your disposal.
* The more you put in the more we can appreciate your time and effort.
* Bring out your inner Da Vinci! Be creative, innovative and original. Make this your masterpiece.
